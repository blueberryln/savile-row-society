                <strong>What is Savile Row Society?</strong>
                <div>
                    SavileRow Society is a web based men&apos;s personal shopping platform. Our mission is to deliver an efficient, educational and interactive shopping experience for the man who cares about style but lacks the time to acquire it.

                 <strong>How was the idea for Savile Row Society developed?</strong>
                <div>A man has to shop either by going store-to-store or buy online.
    But men hate wasting time going store to store and are weary of buying online because of fitting issues and the hassle of returning items if they get the size wrong.<br /><br />The easiest solution to this problem is to get a personal stylist!
    The fundamental purpose of Savile Row Society is to provide this valuable service to men in search of style.
    We guide them step-by-step on how to build a better wardrobe and refine their image through our curated collection of menswear products and our skilled personal stylists.
