    <div class="fourteen offset-by-one columns">
        <p>
            Our Clothes-to-Customer algorithm (designed by a machine learner and a stylist) displays personalized product suggestions to each customer based on their style profile and their interactions with The Closet. Liking a product on The Closet helps the algorithm get to know you better and make better product suggestions to you.
        </p>
        <!--<p>We do this through the StyleScan&trade;, a complex algorithm that blends the results of your 'dual-perspective' style profile with your social media presence, as well as any other details we've compiled through our clever technology. Now, you may ask, how does it work?</p>
        <p>Our experts will provide you with recommendations for your needs â€“ based on their years of experience and assistance from our StyleScan&trade;, your measurements, a few pictures of yourself, including information about upcoming professional or social responsibilities. </p>
        <div class="long-desc hide">
            <p>When it comes to style, perception is everything. That's why we recommend that you complete not only one, but two style profiles: one by you and the other by someone close to you. This way, we get to know not only how you see yourself, but also how someone else sees you. Then, we combine this feedback with activity on your customized online SRS blog (e.g. items you've &quot;liked&quot; or added to your &quot;wishlist&quot;), - Then we present you with bite-sized recommendations that will resonate with you. As the months go by, we will continue to develop and refine our vision, presenting you with more recommendations. <br>
                Choose one thing, choose everything, or choose nothing: there's no obligation to buy. </p>
            <p>How do I know my clothes will fit? Our stylist just happen to be fit experts but just to give us the facts... New members will receive an SRS tape measure and we will walk you through the measurement process via our easy to follow web tutorial. You'll also have our team of stylists on-call to help you during any stage of the process. If you have a favorite outfit you already own, just let us know and we'll gladly ensure you get the same fit.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, clients can choose the level of interaction they would like with the SRS team: from no personal contact to a 100% seamless online relationship to an in-home wardrobe consultation with one of our stylists. The choice is up to you! </p>
