    As you are a friend of the Savile Row Society Team, I wanted to give you a sneak peak of what is to come at Savile Row Society before we are in full operation in early April. I have been working with a team of expert stylists to launch an exclusive men’s club that specializes in customized shopping services.  Our mission is to enhance the personal branding of professional males and to transform men’s shopping through an incredibly seamless, online, personalized fashion service. In doing so, we will help you put your best foot forward while saving you endless hours of comparison shopping. <br/>
    <br/>
    Men today no longer remain with one company or profession for their entire career, making it much harder to create a brand for themselves.  Personal image is therefore more important than ever for career mobility and advancement.   However, many professional men simply do not have the time, energy, or desire to shop store-to-store in order to enhance their personal image. <br/>
    <br/>
    As a member, you would have a personal profile and a go‐to stylist who would get to know your individual tastes and professional aspirations.  SRS styling experts would provide recommendations for all of your needs – based on our informative StyleQ (a brief, fun questionnaire) and StyleScan (which includes providing a few pictures of yourself). <br/>
    <br/>
    Our primary focus at SRS is to provide perfectly customized outfits for our members, but we will also offer grooming recommendations and style advice from noteworthy men who have made branding a part of their business tool kit. Additionally available to our members will be discounts at various restaurants and other businesses. <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: Custom suiting is only offered to our six-fold squire members.  In-home wardrobe consultations are included as a part of our custom private label Savile Row Society suiting operation.   We also offer on-going web based video consultations, if that is what your schedule demands. <br/>
    <br/>
    Become a first mover with SRS now and enjoy the first three months free (once we are in operation). Or register now so you can submit questions to our expert SRS personal stylists and personal trainer, and so we know what to source for you for the Spring! You can also get an amazing luxury surprise gift unavailable anywhere else on the web (sent straight to your door!) or a gift certificate for that loved one who needs to sharpen his image.   Additionally, please check out our exclusive, SRS designed iphone and ipad cases. (Gift certificates and free membership will take effect once we are in operation in April.) So before our full launch, enjoy our ever developing site and the many exciting things happening here at SRS! <br/>
